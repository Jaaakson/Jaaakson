# 👋 Hey, I'm [Jakson](https://github.com/Jaaakson)!

I believe data is just noise until you ask the right questions.

I am a **Data Science major** focused on extracting signal from that noise to solve real-world problems.

While I speak **Python**, **SQL**, and **R**, my strongest asset is my **curiosity**.

I don't just write code; I build tools that make sense of the world.

If there is a dataset to be explored or a problem to be solved, I’m likely already working on it.

**My Philosophy:**
* **Explore:** Always digging deeper than the surface numbers.
* **Build:** Creating solutions, not just analyzing spreadsheets.
* **Impact:** Prioritizing projects that drive decisions and solve actual problems.

**_Learning by doing, improving every day._**
